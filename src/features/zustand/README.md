## Zustand State Management

### Characteristics:
- Traditional state management approach similar to Redux/Context
- Re-renders components that consume the state
- Supports manual optimization techniques:
  - Selective state subscription
  - Memoization
  - Shallow comparison

### Best Practices:
- Use selective state selectors to minimize re-renders
- Implement proper memoization where needed
- Structure state to minimize unnecessary updates

### Performance Comparison
When compared to signals:
- Components re-render when consuming state changes
- Traditional state updates trigger re-renders of the entire component tree
- Performance optimizations require manual implementation of memoization and careful state structure

### Use Cases:
- Applications with complex global state
- When you need Redux-like state management without the boilerplate
- Projects that require middleware and state persistence
- When team is familiar with traditional state management patterns
